## Introduction

The project consists of producer and consumer tasks managed by a `ThreadManager` class. Producers produce items, consumers consume them, and the `ThreadManager` coordinates their interactions.

## Features

- **Producer-Consumer Interaction:** Demonstrates the classic producer-consumer problem with thread management.
- **Thread Safety:** Utilizes synchronization to ensure thread safety during list manipulation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `Main` class.
3. Observe the interactions between producers and consumers in the console.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Thread Management
- Synchronization
